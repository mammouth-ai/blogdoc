## Dev

Before anything, you need to install [git lfs](https://git-lfs.com)

Then activate it:

```bash
git lfs install
```

This will asure large files are treated as references (git doesn't like binary files).

### Launching dev server + integrated browser automatically

In VSCode, you need to do this:

```
Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + P
→ Tasks: Manage Automatic Tasks in Folder
→ Allow Automatic Tasks
```

Then on each subsequent opening of the project the dev server launches automatically when opening VSCode, as well as a preview integrated web browser tab.
