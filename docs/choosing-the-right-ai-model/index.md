# Choosing the Right AI Model

## What is the best model for my prompt?

This is a very legitimate and frequent question among our users. Our answer is as follows:

::: tip ➡️ **There is no universally "superior" AI model for what you want to do.**
Therefore, the best approach is to **put models in competition**:

- Send your request to a first model
- Reprompt with a second model
- Choose between the two proposals or iterate with a 3rd model

Having multiple options is currently the most reliable way to obtain an excellent quality result.

:::info 🧾 **Demonstration**

To understand this, you need to look at how **reference benchmarks** like [**lmsys.org**](https://lmarena.ai/leaderboard) or [**livebench.ai**](http://livebench.ai) work. These sites compare AIs on thousands of questions (reasoning, math, code, writing, etc.) to establish statistics. But be careful when interpreting these scores:

- **they are probabilities, not guarantees**: a model ranked #1 simply has a statistically higher chance of giving a better answer than #5, but for a specific question, #5 may very well be better.
- **the gaps are minimal**: today, the pure performance differences between market leaders have become tiny, often indistinguishable for everyday use.

We are therefore observing a paradigm shift as AIs progress.

- **before:** we chose the model that gave the *correct* answer.
- **today:** several models give objectively correct answers, so the choice becomes more subjective: writing style, tone of communication, presentation structure, etc...

**In summary**: the best answer increasingly depends on your personal preference, and no one can predict with certainty which model will best respond to your request before comparing them.

| 🎓 | **Reasoning** | Complex problem-solving and logical analysis <br> Advanced code and debugging <br> Strategy development and decision support |
| ⚡ | **Lightweight Generation** | Quick tasks and simple iterations <br> Drafts and basic visual creations |

## Reprompting: what Mammouth usage data reveals

Our users' statistics confirm that **reprompting is a high-value practice**: the more complex or creative the request, the more essential comparison between models becomes.

### **34% of text requests are reprompted**

- **24%** with another model → the user validates the result by cross-checking 2 AIs
- **12%** with 2+ other models → the user challenges 3 or more AIs to obtain the ultimate answer

**What this means:** as soon as the stakes increase, our users adopt a comparative strategy:

- 🎯 Technical complexity → cross-verification
- ✨ Creative excellence → exploring different tones and angles
- 💎 Optimal formulation → comparison to find the ideal answer

### **For image generation:**

The phenomenon is even more pronounced:

- **41% of requests are reprompted** (vs 34% for text)
- **19%** with 2+ other models

**Why?** Images are inherently subjective: visual style, composition, artistic interpretation vary greatly from one model to another. Comparison becomes almost indispensable.

### **What this proves**

✅ **Reprompting is not a waste of time, it's a quality signal**: users adopt it spontaneously for their most demanding tasks

✅ **1 in 3 times** users consider that a single answer is not enough for important requests

✅ **Mammouth's value** lies precisely in this ability to compare without friction: reprompting means upgrading quality
