## **What is a mammouth assistant ?**

It is a mammouth with a contextual instruction attached to all his queries.

> üí°*Good to know : engineers call this instruction "system prompt".*

## **What is the best practice to instruct a mammouth ?**

**DO**: Give your mammouth 3 types of instructions:

- A role
- (optional) A given knowledge
- (optional) A specific methodology

**DON'T**¬†give: a task (e.g. "correct my email"). The task is for the prompt.

## **Organize your conversations**

You can use your colorful mammouth to organize your conversations.

Instructions are optional: without instructions, the mammouth will behave the same as the default mammouth.

Image models and OpenPerplex are available in assistants for conversation sorting.\
These models ignore the custom instructions.
