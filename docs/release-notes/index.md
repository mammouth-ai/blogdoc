# Release notes - Mammouth AI

## September 16th 2025

**⭐ New models ⭐**

- **Nano Banana** (_aka Gemini 2.5 Flash Image_): can edit images and handle conversations.
- **DeepSeek v3.1** (replace DeepSeek v3)

**⚡ Start a conversation with light models**

You can start a new conversation with any light model even if you've not reached your quota.

**🧷 API services for your automations**

- Buy additional credits in the [api settings](https://mammouth.ai/app/account/settings/api).
- You can also buy credits without having a subscription.
- GPT-5, GPT-5-mini, GPT-5-nano, Claude 4.1 Opus, Mistral 3.1, DeepSeek v3.1 are now supported.

**And also**

- **Improved handling of multiple documents** in a conversation: short documents were sometimes overshadowed by long ones and the AI missed them; that's no longer the case.
- **Document generation**: some models occasionally refused to generate a file (pdf, docx, xls); this is now fixed.
- The [pricing page](https://mammouth.ai/pricing) was updated to highlight the Team plan and provide up-to-date information about the growing Mammouth offering (API credits, Perplexity, Vocal mode, etc.).
- We updated our [Terms of Service](https://info.mammouth.ai/docs/terms-of-service/).
- **GPT-5** now comes with:
  - better text formatting
  - functional math equation rendering. 
  - the thinking process is now visible.

## August 25th 2025

**⭐ New model: Mistral Medium 3.1**

**📁 Long Context & Documents**

We've significantly improved the handling of long contexts (long input & documents): more context capacity, better content extraction, improved management of long code context, faster performance, fewer errors etc...

**🎨 UX Improvements**

- The code-copy button is now floating for easier access
- Copying and pasting emails or HTML content no longer adds unwanted line breaks
- Refined mobile navigation for a smoother experience
- More custom mammouths are now visible in the sidebar
- Max mammouth count increased from 12 to 16.

**🌐 Web Access for all AIs**

We've expanded web capabilities to Mistral, Claude, DeepSeek, Grok and Llama!

## August 8th 2025

**⭐ GPT-5**
- GPT 5 replaces GPT-4.1
- GPT-5 mini replaces GPT-4.1 mini
- GPT-5 Thinking (GPT-5 with enhanced systematic reasoning) replaces o3 & o4-mini

**🦣 Each custom mammoth now has his own default model**, and his own model display order, before pressing Enter

**✍️ Your prompt is saved as a draft** and persists when you switch conversations or refresh the page, until you send it.

## August 4th 2025

### ⭐ New Models

### ↪️ Reprompting conversation
Every user message from a conversation can now be reprompted, not only the first one. It works as a fork of the conversation. 

### ✨ Multi-model conversation
Conversations are now specific to a brand and not a model, so you can switch from a text model, to an image model or a reasoning model in the same conversation

### And also
- When a quota is reached, the conversation continues with the unlimited model of the same brand (no more starting a new conversation after quota reached)
- Grok logo has been updated from xAI logo to Grok logo
- You can delete the previous message of a conversation and therefore come back to the n-2 message and so on.
- The 404 error page (and others as well) now displays a cute mammoth
