# How to Write Effective Prompts

## What is a prompt?

To fully harness Mammouth's potential, master the art of communicating clearly with AI models.

Prompts are the language of dialogue between you and the AI. They define the framework of the exchange and determine the quality of responses. Clear formulation generates relevant and actionable results.

**The essential**: working with AI requires no technical expertise. You simply need to learn to communicate with it as you would with a colleague.

## Key Principles

1. 🎯 **Be specific**: clearly state your request. Avoid vague instructions
2. 📝 **Give context**: specify the subject, audience, expected format
3. 🔤 **Illustrate**: examples serve as a model for the AI
4. 👨‍🎤 **Assign a role**: a specific persona guides the tone of the response
5. 🏗️ **Break it down**: guide the AI step by step for complex tasks
6. 🧪 **Test**: if you understand your instructions, so will the AI.
7. 🔄 **Iterate**: adjust until you get the desired result.

## Recommended Structure

<span style="color: #d9534f;">**Role**</span>: Give the AI a persona

<span style="color: #f0ad4e;">**Objective**</span>: What is its mission? Detail the steps for complex processes.

<span style="color: #5cb85c;">**Audience**</span>: Specify who the AI should address

<span style="color: #5bc0de;">**Constraints/style**</span>: Rules governing behavior (language, format, frequency).

<span style="color: #9b59b6;">**Output format**</span>: Specify the expected output (text, table, code)
