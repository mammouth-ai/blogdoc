# About privacy

Privacy matters to us (we are based in Europe, the home of the GDPR üôÇ).

We make money on the subscription you pay us, not on something else.

## 1. We don‚Äôt use your data to train models

We focus on delivering a user interface that provide the best of AI. We don‚Äôt train internal models.

## 2. Personal data

Parted in three categories:

**User data** <br>
Mammouth AI will keep your prompt data for the display of past conversations in history and to provide user assistance. <br>
If you delete your data, we might keep the data for no more than 30 rolling days to monitor abuse, then delete it.

**Account data** <br>
We have to keep this data for the duration of your registration on the Services and for 1 year from the end of your registration for evidentiary purposes.

**Security data** <br>
The security logs are stored for 1 rolling year.

## 3. What the models providers do with your prompts

As we use proprietary AI models, we have to conform to their privacy policies. They differ depending on the provider. We‚Äôve gone through them, here‚Äôs a quick summary for the main ones:

1. OpenAI: "You own and control your data ‚Ä¶ We do not train our models on your business data by default". See [Enterprise Privacy at OpenAI](https://openai.com/enterprise-privacy/).
2. Mistral: we pay their API service, [their policy](https://mistral.ai/fr/terms/#data-processing-agreement) (article `2.2.2.2 Our Paid Services`) states: ‚ÄúWe do not use Your User Data to train, improve or enhance our Models.‚Äù They only keep the data 30 days to monitor abuse. We love Mistral.
3. Anthropic Claude: we conform to the [Commercial Terms of Service](https://www.anthropic.com/legal/commercial-terms), which states (A. Service, 4.) "Anthropic may not train models on Customer Content from paid Services".
4. Gemini: We use it through Google Cloud API, and their data governance doc states that "Gemini doesn't use your prompts or its responses as data to train its models." You can learn more about the specifity of [Gemini data governance](https://cloud.google.com/gemini/docs/discover/data-governance?hl=en).
5. DeepSeek and Llama models are open source. The provider we use to serve the model is Fireworks, the prompts sent are not used to improve the model. You can know more about their privacy policy [here](https://fireworks.ai/privacy-policy).
