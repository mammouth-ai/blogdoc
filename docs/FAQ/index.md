### How do I change my email address ?
We do not support updating the email address associated with your Mammouth account.
So you'll need to cancel the subscription from the old email and create a new subscription with the new account.

It is planned on our roadmap to add this option to change the account email.

### Can I get a refund ?
Check our [refund policy](/docs/refund-policy/index.md).

### I am subscribed but I am stuck on the susbcription page and asked to select a plan
When you create a subscription, you can choose a billing email. This email will receive the monthly invoices. However, it can differ from your Mammouth email account. Make sure that you are trying to connect with the correct email.
