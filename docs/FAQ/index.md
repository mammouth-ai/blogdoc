## Product

### Is it normal for an AI model to give an incorrect version when asked about its identity?
Yes and no! By default, AI models don’t know their own identity because this information isn’t part of their training data and they don’t have self-awareness. To address this, providers like Mammouth add special instructions so the AI can answer identity questions correctly.
In your case, those instructions weren’t set up. You might encounter this issue if:
- You are using a custom Mammouth: Here, you can assign any identity you want to the AI, and your custom instructions will override the default identity instructions.
- The default identity instructions didn’t activate with your specific prompt.

### How do I delete my data ?
You can delete all your data at anytime. It will then be deleted from all our servers.
- When you delete a conversation, it will delete all messages and attachments (images, documents) associated with the conversation
- When you delete a custom mammouth, it will delete all conversations from the custom mammouth as well 
- When you delete all conversations, it will delete all conversations from all the mammouths
- When you delete your data
