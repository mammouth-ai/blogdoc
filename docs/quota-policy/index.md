### **Precisions:**

- The **Fair Usage Quota** (total allowed prompts) covers **all content types** combined, including text messages, image generations, and long messages/documents.
- **Documents/Long Messages:** The "documents" quota refers to any message or document exceeding **10,000 characters** (aprx. 3 pages on a PDF).
    - A document of less than 10,000 characters counts as a regular text message
    - An input text message of more than 10,000 characters counts as a document
- **Unlimited Model:** If you exceed your quota, you will transition to **unlimited models** (e.g. GPT-4o-mini) to ensure uninterrupted service.
- **Fair Usage Quota:** Once the fair usage quota is reached, only GPT-4o-mini is available.
- **Quota Refresh Rates:** Quotas automatically reset on a rolling window based on the predefined timeframes (e.g., every 3 hours or every 30 days).
- **The Input Length** is the sum of all attached documents characters with the user prompt characters and the contextual instruction from the custom mammouth.
