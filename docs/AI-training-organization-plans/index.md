### Example Scenario

If you typically conduct training sessions for groups of 10-20 participants each week, you'd need a 20-seat license. With this plan, you can reassign licenses to different participants between sessions.

Your 20-seat license package would include:
* 1 admin permanent license
* 1 non-admin permanent license
* Up to 20 switchable temporary guest licenses

Each guest account will have full access to Mammouth's services, including text, reasoning, and image AI models, as well as all Mammouth features. Quotas reset to zero for each new guest.
