### **Precisions:**

- The **Fair Usage Quota** (total allowed prompts) covers **all content types** combined, including text messages, reasoning requests, image generations, and long messages/documents.
- **Documents/Long Messages:** The "documents" quota refers to any message or document exceeding **10,000 characters**.
    - A document of less than 10 000 characters counts as a regular text message
    - An input text message of more than 10 000 characters counts as a document
- **Unlimited Model:** If you exceed your quota, you will transition to **unlimited models** (e.g. GPT-4o-mini) to ensure uninterrupted service.
- **Fair Usage Quota:** Once the fair usage quota is reached, only GPT-4o-mini is available.
- **Quota Refresh Rates:** Quotas automatically reset on a rolling window based on the predefined timeframes (e.g., every 3 hours, daily, or monthly).
    - Daily is defined as every 16 hours
    - Monthly is defined as every 30 days
- **The Input Length** is the sum of all attached documents characters and the user prompt characters.
