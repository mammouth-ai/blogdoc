# Refund policy

Thank you for choosing Mammouth, our AI aggregator service. Please read our refund policy carefully before using our services.

## Right of Withdrawal for Digital Services

Under EU law, consumers generally have the right to withdraw from a digital service contract within 14 days of purchase. However, by starting to use Mammouth, you expressly consent to the immediate supply of our digital service and acknowledge that you lose your right of withdrawal once the service has begun. This is because our service is a consumable digital product: as soon as you start using Mammouth, we incur direct, non-recoverable fees with our AI providers.

## No Refunds After Service Commencement

Due to the consumable nature of our service, no refunds will be issued once you have started using Mammouth. By accessing or using the service, you agree that the service is considered delivered and consumed, and you waive your right to a refund except as outlined below.

## Defective or Non-Conforming Services

If the service is defective, not as described, or otherwise fails to function as promised, you are entitled to request a repair, replacement, or refund in accordance with EU consumer protection laws. Please contact our support team with details of the issue, and we will address your request promptly.
